The main genbank database table (TABLE "genbank") is structured with the following columns. All contain the "text" data type.
Many descriptions below were adapted from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/samplerecord/ on 28 Apr 2020.
Database cross-references were deliberately ignored because I'm not interested in exploring them at the moment, but
they'll be easy enough to add back in later if I'm interested.

ID - the genbank ID number, formatted as accession_number.version_number
accession - The unique identifier for a sequence record. An accession number applies to the complete record and is
            usually a combination of a letter(s) and numbers
name - the unique name for the genbank record, may be the same as its accession number
description - Brief description of sequence; includes information such as source organism, gene name/protein name, or
              some description of the sequence's function (if the sequence is non-coding).
molecule_type - the type of molecule that was sequenced
topology - The physical shape of the molecule. E.g., linear or circular DNA.
genbank_division - The GenBank division to which a record belongs. Indicated with a three letter abbreviation.
                   More information on the different divisions can be found at
                   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/samplerecord/#GenBankDivisionB
date - the date the genbank record was last modified
source - The organism or molecule type that this sequence came from. Free-format, possibly abbreviated
organism - The formal scientific name for the source organism (genus and species, where appropriate).
taxonomy - The most specific phylogenetic classification for the genbank record object. Will be used in conjunction
           with the taxonomy table to reconstruct phylogenies (see "TABLE taxonomy" description).
seq - The nucleic or amino acid sequence

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE "references" provides all the references associated with each genbank ID. Columns are as follows:

ID - The genbank ID number, formatted as accession_number.version_number. Field contains text.
feature_start - The initial position (in bp) that the reference refers to. Field contains an integer.
feature_end - The final position (in bp) that the reference refers to. Field contains an integer.
authors - List of authors in the order in which they appear in the cited article. Field contains text.
journal - MEDLINE abbreviation of the journal name. Field contains text.
comment - Further comments regarding a sequence/submission. Not present in all genbank entries.

Of note, entries with "Direct Submission" instead of an article title include contact information of the submitter,
such as institute/department and postal address. Some older records do not contain a submitter block.

TABLE "taxonomy" provides the means for recreating the taxonomic tree associated with each genbank ID. May or may not
actually implement this one. Or I'll just make a simple version.

Columns will be as follows:

self - The current taxa
parent - The supergroup for the current taxa

By repeatedly querying the taxonomy table to find the parent of each parent, one can create the entire taxonomic
hierarchy for a single given organism. Work remains to be done to refine this design and implement it, likely by
reducing the amount of work needed to recreate the tree by storing common paths (near the root, like saving the few
life/realm/kingdom paths as one thing, since it'll be the same for most organisms)
