The list of things I'd like this database builder to accomplish, and whether or not the code can currently
accomplish them.

[x] Create the main genbank table
[ ] Create the references table
        - almost done!
        - properly handle compound locations
        - double check article title was inserted correctly
        - double check what comments are (same as article title?)
        - what is hf?
[ ] Create the taxonomy table
        - not started
        - link genus/species in genbank entry to genus/species in taxonomy table. Each thing in taxonomy list links
          to previous thing, so you can trace it up a list (e.g., cerevisiae will point to Saccharomyces)
        - might be easier to do by building off of NCBI's taxonomy database?
          https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/
[ ] Build the features table
        - columns chosen, need to be implemented
        - Include basics (feature type, location, select things from feature.qualifiers (TODO: pick which qualifiers to include))
[ ] Run it on all of genbank!
